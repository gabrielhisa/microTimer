# MicroTimer

A simple JavaFX project for a minimalistic, lightweight timer. Useful for gamind, studying or just tracking activities.

## Elements

This is a minimalistic timer application that stays on top of other windows while providing accurate time tracking. Techs used:

 - Java 25 + Maven
 - JavaFX 21.0.6 (Controls, FXML)
 - FXML for UI Layout, via code and SceneBuilder

## Points of interest

 - Millisecond precision
 - Always on top of all windows
 - Draggable interface
 - Minimalistic UI: just 2 buttons and only useful information on screen

## Challenges in development

  - Mostly making sense of how to associate JavaFX elements to Java code
  - Using JavaFX to manage time, instead of the usual Java Unix Epoch Time
  - Making the executable, first time doing so and had to research a modern approach using Maven

## Prerequisites

 - Java 25
 - Maven 3.6
